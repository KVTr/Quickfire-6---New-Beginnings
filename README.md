# Quickfire 6 - New Beginnings
<br>
The map features a grand total of 15 dungeons to find wool in and explore! It also has a new layout unlike the past ones. Each area is connected with a natural transition and with actual intersections! (Woah!) So go ahead and tackle it if you dare, although be warned, the map is neither balance tested nor really a full product. It was made in an hour after all. This is... Quickfire: New Beginnings.
